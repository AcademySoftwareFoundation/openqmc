NVIDIA Covenant Not to Assert for the OpenQMC Project
 
NVIDIA, on behalf of itself and its affiliates and their successors and
assigns, hereby provides this perpetual, worldwide, and irrevocable
covenant not to assert any patent claims it owns or can license that are
necessarily infringed by the openqmc-main package of the OpenQMC
repository (github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openqmc) as it existed
on June 18, 2025 (the “Covered Product”).

This covenant protects any user, developer, or distributor of the
Covered Product (each a “Beneficiary”).

However, if any Beneficiary institutes or materially assists patent
litigation at any time against NVIDIA or its affiliates, successors, or
assigns, then this covenant is terminated for that Beneficiary as of the
date such patent litigation is filed.
