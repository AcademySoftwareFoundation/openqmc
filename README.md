OpenQMC is a library for sampling high quality Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) points
and generating pseudo random numbers. Designed for graphics applications,
the library is part of Framestore's proprietary renderer [Freak](https://www.framestore.com/work/rendering)
and is actively used in VFX production.

## Description

This C++14 (CPU, GPU) header only library provides an API to deliver high
quality QMC sample points. The API aims to be compatible with a variety of
common use cases found in production codebases. The library also provides
multiple state of the art back-end implementations to minimise noise.

There are three primary aims for the project:

- Standardise a flexible sampler API.
- Deliver performant implementations.
- Provide high quality results.

The project doesn't aim to:

- Implement an exhaustive list of sequences.
- Provide educational implementations.

Project features are:

- Supports different architectures (CPU, GPU, etc).
- Static interface / zero cost abstraction.
- Solutions for different sampling use cases.
- Supports progressive / adaptive pixel sampling.
- Suitable for depth and wavefront rendering.
- Clear and extendable code base.
- Unit and statistical testing.
- Modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) based build system.
- Header only and binary configurations.
- No library or STL dependencies.
- Includes tools, docs and examples.

The API lets you focus on writing graphics algorithms while getting bias-free
results and best-in-class convergence rates. The project maintainers would
like developers to leverage QMC sampling everywhere confidently â€” this is what
the OpenQMC API and the concept of [domain branching](#domain-branching) aim
to achieve.

The project is battle-tested. Framestore actively uses a variant of this library
to produce visually rich feature film VFX content and is committed to continue
contributing any further improvements to this open initiative.

## Usage

Here is a quick example of what OpenQMC looks like. Feel free to copy and paste
this code to get yourself started, or continue reading to learn about the API
and techniques for writing more advanced algorithms.

```cpp
// 1. Initialise the sampler cache.
auto cache = new char[oqmc::PmjSampler::cacheSize];
oqmc::PmjSampler::initialiseCache(cache);

// 2. Loop over all pixels in the image.
for(int x = 0; x < resolution; ++x)
{
	for(int y = 0; y < resolution; ++y)
	{
		// 3. Loop over all the sample indices.
		for(int index = 1; index < sampleSize; ++index)
		{
			// 4. Create a sampler object for the pixel domain.
			const auto domain = oqmc::PmjSampler(x, y, 0, index, cache);

			// 5. Draw a sample point from the domain.
			float samples[2];
			domain.drawSample<2>(samples);

			// 6. Offset the point into the pixel.
			const auto xOffset = samples[0] + x;
			const auto yOffset = samples[1] + y;

			// 7. Add value to the pixel if within disk.
			if(xOffset * xOffset + yOffset * yOffset < resolution * resolution)
			{
				image[x * resolution + y] += 1.0f / sampleSize;
			}
		}
	}
}

// 8. Deallocate the sampler cache.
delete[] cache;
```

This algorithm loops over all pixels and for each sample adds a small value if a
random pixel offset falls within a quarter disk. The end result is an image of a
disk with anti-aliased pixels across the edge of the shape.

If you would like to see a real example of a path tracer, have a look at the
source code for the [trace](src/tools/lib/trace.cpp) tool. Or alternatively go
to the [concepts and examples](#concepts-and-examples) section to read about
more advanced solutions.

## Requirements

The library itself has no dependencies other than C++14. Although not tested
with older versions of GCC, this should make it compatible with CY2018 and
newer versions of the [VFX Reference Platform](https://vfxplatform.com).

Supported operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

Supported architectures:

- x86-64
- AArch64
- NVIDIA

Tested compilers:

- Clang 6
- GCC 7.5
- Apple Clang 13
- NVCC 10

## Installation

You can install OpenQMC via either a package manager, or by cloning the source
and installing it directly. The former is easier to get up and going, but the
later will give you some build options to play with.

### NixOS package

OpenQMC is available as a Nix flake package on NixOS and other supported
platforms. The flake can also be used to load a reproducible [developer
environment](#nix-development-environment). Install the package with:

```bash
nix profile install github:framestore/openqmc
```

### Cloning the source

Alternatively for installing from source, you can download a release from the
site, or clone the project with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:framestore/openqmc.git
```

## Adding to your project

There are three methods for adding the library as an upstream dependency to
another project. Examples of each are in the [cmake/examples](cmake/examples)
directory. These are working examples and are continuously validated.

### Add library as a submodule

The first and most recommended method is to add the library as a submodule to
your downstream project, and then include the library using CMake. This is the
fastest and simplest approach.

```cmake
# Optionally set options (they are OFF by default)
set(OPENQMC_ARCH_TYPE AVX CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
set(OPENQMC_ENABLE_BINARY ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(OPENQMC_SHARED_LIB ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)

# Load external dependencies
add_subdirectory(path/to/submodule EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# Optionally mark options as advanced
mark_as_advanced(FORCE OPENQMC_ARCH_TYPE)
mark_as_advanced(FORCE OPENQMC_BUILD_TOOLS)
mark_as_advanced(FORCE OPENQMC_BUILD_TESTING)
mark_as_advanced(FORCE OPENQMC_FORCE_DOWNLOAD)
mark_as_advanced(FORCE OPENQMC_ENABLE_BINARY)
mark_as_advanced(FORCE OPENQMC_SHARED_LIB)
mark_as_advanced(FORCE OPENQMC_FORCE_PIC)

# Add dependencies
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE OpenQMC::OpenQMC)
```

### Add library as a config-module

Another good option is to install the library and use the same configuration
across multiple downstream projects. You may want to do this if the library is
shared between projects.

If you haven't used a package manager before or want to avoid the default
configuration, then you will need to install it from the source. The CMake
installation process will follow an idiomatic approach that provides you the
opportunity to set library build options. An example:

```bash
cmake -B build -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path -D OPENQMC_ENABLE_BINARY=ON
cmake --build build --target install
```

Adding the library then requires a `find_package` call in your downstream CMake
project. `find_package` will access a CMake config file which was created upon
installation, allowing the installed requirements to be loaded automatically.

```cmake
# Find external dependencies
find_package(OpenQMC CONFIG REQUIRED)

# Optionally mark DIR variable as advanced
mark_as_advanced(OpenQMC_DIR)

# Add dependencies
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE OpenQMC::OpenQMC)
```

### Add library manually

Alternatively you can add the library manually as header-only. However, this
method isn't recommended, as it can be error-prone and prevents using build
options otherwise available via CMake.

```cmake
# Enable C++14 support
target_compile_features(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE cxx_std_14)

# Add dependencies
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE path/to/library/include)
```

### Library build options

When adding the library using CMake, there are a set of configuration options
which apply to downstream projects. The options are:

- `OPENQMC_ARCH_TYPE`: Sets the architecture to optimise for on the CPU, or to
  target NVIDIA GPUs. Option values can be `Scalar`, `SSE`, `AVX`, `ARM` or
  `GPU`. Default value is `Scalar`.
- `OPENQMC_ENABLE_BINARY`: You can reduce binary size of downstream projects by
  opting for a binary variant of the library. Option values can be `ON` or
  `OFF`. Default value is `OFF`.
- `OPENQMC_SHARED_LIB`: You can request a shared library instead of the default
  static. This also automatically enables PIC. Option values can be `ON` or
  `OFF`. Default value is `OFF`.
- `OPENQMC_FORCE_PIC`: When compiling a static library and the downstream
  project is a shared library, you can force enable PIC. Option values can be
  `ON` or `OFF`. Default value is `OFF`.

## Versioning

Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) to indicate
how changes affect the API between releases of the library. Given a version
number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, incrementing a version means:

1. MAJOR indicates an incompatible API change.
2. MINOR indicates a backwards compatible feature addition.
3. PATCH indicates a backwards compatible bug fix.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata may be present as
extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

You can access details on what changed for each new version at
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). This follows the format from [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## API reference

Down stream projects have access to individual components used to build the
samplers, and are free to use these directly. But it's recommended that users
take advantage of the sampler interface which defines a generic API for all
implementations, and provides a contract to the calling code.

The API is a static (compile-time polymorphic) interface. This is an important
detail, as it allows for implementations to be passed-by-value without dynamic
memory allocation, while also allowing inlining for zero-cost abstraction.

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Required allocation size of the cache.
 * @details Prior to construction of a sampler object, a cache needs to be
 * allocated and initialised for any given sampler type. This variable is
 * the minimum required size in bytes of that allocation. The allocation
 * itself is performed and owned by the caller. Responsibility for the
 * de-allocation is also that of the caller.
 */
static std::size_t oqmc::Sampler::cacheSize;
```

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Initialise the cache allocation.
 * @details Prior to construction of a sampler object, a cache needs to be
 * allocated and initialised for any given sampler type. This function will
 * initialise that allocation. Once the cache is initialised it may be used
 * to construct a sampler object, or copied to a new address.
 *
 * Care must be taken to make sure the memory address is accessible at the
 * point of construction. On the CPU this is trivial. But when constructing
 * a sampler object on the GPU, the caller is expected to either use unified
 * memory for the allocation, or manually copy the memory from the host to
 * the device after the cache has been initialised.
 *
 * A single cache (for each sampler type) is expected to be constructed only
 * once for the duration of a calling process. This single cache can be used
 * to construct many sampler objects.
 *
 * @param [in, out] cache Memory address of the cache allocation.
 *
 * @pre Memory for the cache must be allocated prior. The minimum size of
 * the allocation can be retrieved using the `cacheSize` variable above.
 *
 * @post Memory for the cache must be de-allocated after all instances of
 * the sampler object have been destroyed.
 */
static void oqmc::Sampler::initialiseCache(void* cache);
```

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Parametrised pixel constructor.
 * @details Create a sampler object based on the pixel, frame and sample
 * indices. This also requires a pre-allocated and initialised cache. Once
 * constructed the sampler object is valid and ready for use.
 *
 * Values for sampleId should be within the [0, 2^16) range; this constraint
 * allows for possible optimisations in the implementations.
 *
 * @param x [in] Pixel coordinate on the x axis.

 * this constructor, and has also been initialised.
 */
oqmc::Sampler::Sampler(int x, int y, int frame, int sampleId, const void* cache);
```

 * will be well distributed locally. But care must be taken as this local
 * pattern will be of lower quality when combined with the local patterns of
 * other samples. As the correlation between the patterns globally has been
 * lost. If the multiplier (the amount of times nextDomainIndex is to be
 * called) is known and constant, newDomainSplit can be used instead to
 * produce the best quality results.
 *
 * @param [in] key Index key of next domain.
 * @return Child domain based on the current object state and key.
 */

 *
 * The function should only be called on domains that have been configured

## Implementation comparison

The API is common to all back-end implementations. Each implementation has
different strengths that balance performance and quality. These are all the
implementations and their required header files:

- [`oqmc/pmj.h`](include/oqmc/pmj.h): Includes low discrepancy `oqmc::PmjSampler`.
- [`oqmc/pmjbn.h`](include/oqmc/pmjbn.h): Includes blue noise variant `oqmc::PmjBnSampler`.
- [`oqmc/sobol.h`](include/oqmc/sobol.h): Includes Owen scrambled `oqmc::SobolSampler`.
- [`oqmc/sobolbn.h`](include/oqmc/sobolbn.h): Includes blue noise variant `oqmc::SobolBnSampler`.
- [`oqmc/lattice.h`](include/oqmc/lattice.h): Includes rank one `oqmc::LatticeSampler`.
- [`oqmc/latticebn.h`](include/oqmc/latticebn.h): Includes blue noise variant `oqmc::LatticeBnSampler`.
- [`oqmc/oqmc.h`](include/oqmc/oqmc.h): Convenience header includes all implementations.

This diagram gives a high level view of the available implementations and how
they relate to one another. Each implementation includes a blue noise variant
which you can read more about [here](#spatial-temporal-blue-noise).

  <img alt="High level implementation diagram." src="./images/diagrams/high-level-overview-light.png">
</picture>

The following subsections will provide some analysis on each of the
implementations and outline their tradeoffs, so that you can make an informed
decision on what implementation would be best for your use case.

### Rate of convergence

These plots show the rate of convergence for different implementations across
different two-dimensional integrals. Each plot takes the average of 128 runs,
plotting a data point for each sample count value.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/plots/error-plot-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/plots/error-plot-dark.png">
  <img alt="Error plot comparison." src="./images/plots/error-plot-light.png">
</picture>

The following plots show, for a fixed sample count, how the error decreases
with a Gaussian filter as the standard deviation increases. It shows,
especially for low samples counts, the faster convergence of the blue noise
variants. This is an indicator that these may be a better option if your images
are then filtered with a de-noise pass.

  <img alt="Error filter space plot comparison." src="./images/plots/error-filter-space-plot-light.png">
</picture>

The preceding plots filtered the error spatially. The following plots filter
the error temporally. They show that averaging the frames over time also
favours the blue noise variants. Useful if you feed the frames into a temporal
antialiasing algorithm.

  <img alt="Error filter time plot comparison." src="./images/plots/error-filter-time-plot-light.png">
</picture>

### Zoneplates

These plots show zoneplate tests for each sampler implementation, and give an
indication of any potential for structural aliasing across varying frequencies
and directions. Often this manifests as a moirÃ© pattern.

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/plots/zoneplate-plot-dark.png">
  <img alt="Zoneplate test comparison." src="./images/plots/zoneplate-plot-light.png">
</picture>

### Performance

In these charts you can see the time it takes to compute N samples for each
implementation. Each sample takes 256 dimensions. It also shows the cost of
cache initialisation, this is often a trade-off for runtime performance. The
plot measured the results on an Apple Silicon M1 Max with `OPENQMC_ARCH_TYPE`
set to `ARM` for Neon intrinsics.

### Pixel sampling

These are path-traced images of the Cornell box comparing the results from each
implementation. The top row of insets shows pixel variance due to the visibility
term; the bottom row shows the variance of sampling a light at a grazing angle.
Each inset had 2 samples per pixel. Numbers indicate RMSE.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/plots/cornell-box-0-2-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/plots/cornell-box-0-2-dark.png">

  <img alt="Cornell box indirect comparison." src="./images/plots/cornell-box-1-2-light.png">
</picture>

With higher sample counts per pixel (the results below are using 32 samples)
the difference between the sampler implementations becomes greater as the
higher rate of convergence takes effect.

## Concepts and examples

OpenQMC aims to provide an API that makes using high quality samples easy and
bias-free when writing software with numerical integration. You have already
seen a very basic example of this in the [Usage](#usage) section. This section
will go into more detail on the concepts and provide some more complex examples.

The section will build upon a simple example, introduce the concepts of domain
trees and sample splitting, and show some of the potential pitfalls OpenQMC
prevents by following some basic rules. After this, you should be able to
confidently make use of QMC sampling in your own software.

### Sampling domains

When you estimate an integral using the Monte Carlo method, the high dimensional
space can often be partitioned into logical domains. In OpenQMC domains are an
important concept. Domains act as promises that can be converted into dimensions
upon request by the caller. They can also be chained to create new domains.

This example function tries to compute a pixel estimate. This estimate is made
up of two parts, each needing a domain. The first is a `camera` that takes a
single sample, and the second is a `material`, that takes two samples.

```cpp
Result estimatePixel(const oqmc::PmjSampler pixelDomain,
                     const CameraInterface& camera,
                     const MaterialInterface& material)
{
	enum DomainKey
	{
		Next,
	};

	// Derive 'cameraDomain' from 'pixelDomain' parameter.
	const auto cameraDomain = pixelDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Next);

	// Derive 'materialDomain' from 'cameraDomain' variable.
	const auto materialDomain = cameraDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Next);

	// Take a single sample for time to pass to 'camera'.
	float timeSamples[1];
	cameraDomain.drawSample<1>(timeSamples);

	// Take two samples for direction to pass to 'material'.
	float directionSamples[2];
	materialDomain.drawSample<2>(directionSamples);

	// Pass drawn samples to the interface an importance sampling.
	const auto cameraSample = camera.sample(timeSamples);
	const auto materialSample = material.sample(directionSamples);

	// Using resulting samples, compute pixel estimate.
	return sampleLightTransport(cameraSample, materialSample);
}
```

The function started with an initial `pixelDomain`, from that it derived a
`cameraDomain`, and from that it derived a `materialDomain`. This is a linear
sequence of dependent domains. Domains provide up to 4 dimensions each. If more
dimensions are required, the caller can always derive a new domain.

</picture>

This example works, but isn't very flexible. This can be improved. Types that
implement the camera or material interfaces may require less or more samples
than is provided by the calling code.

### Passing domains

Computing domains is cheap, but drawing samples is expensive. In the
last example, samples were drawn and passed to a type that implements the
`MaterialInterface`. If the samples are not required, the type doesn't have the
option to prevent the samples from being drawn.

You can resolve this by changing the interface to pass a domain, deferring the
decision to draw samples to the type. Here are two types that implement such an
interface, `DiffuseMaterial` and `SpecularMaterial`.

```cpp
MaterialSample DiffuseMaterial::sample(const oqmc::PmjSampler materialDomain)
{
	// Draw two samples for direction.
	float directionSamples[2];
	materialDomain.drawSample<2>(directionSamples);

	// Compute MaterialSample object using the drawn samples...
}

MaterialSample SpecularMaterial::sample(const oqmc::PmjSampler materialDomain)
{
	// Don't draw two samples for direction.
	// float directionSamples[2];
	// materialDomain.drawSample<2>(directionSamples);

	// Compute MaterialSample object without using samples...
}
```

The `DiffuseMaterial` draws samples from the domain. But `SpecularMaterial` opts
to save on compute and does not draw samples as they are not required.

Looking at the revised calling code, the domains are now passed through the
interfaces, allowing the types to decide whether to draw the samples or not.

```cpp
Result estimatePixel(const oqmc::PmjSampler pixelDomain,
                     const CameraInterface& camera,
                     const MaterialInterface& material)
{
	enum DomainKey
	{
		Next,
	};

	// Derive 'cameraDomain' from 'pixelDomain' parameter.
	const auto cameraDomain = pixelDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Next);

	// Derive 'materialDomain' from 'cameraDomain' variable.
	const auto materialDomain = cameraDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Next);

	// Pass domains directly to the interface to compute samples.
	const auto cameraSample = camera.sample(cameraDomain);
	const auto materialSample = material.sample(materialDomain);

	// Using samples, compute pixel estimate.
	return sampleLightTransport(cameraSample, materialSample);
}
```

Sometimes a type needs an unknown number of samples. The next section will show
how that can be achieved. This will introduce a potential danger, as well as a
new concept called domain trees that can be used to do the operation safely.

### Domain branching

Building on the previous example, the calling code is free of knowing how many
samples a type might need. If a type requires N samples, it can opt to derive
new domains from the domain that was passed to it. Then drawing more samples
from those domains.

This is a `ThinLensCamera` type that implements the `CameraInterface` interface.
It requires multiple domains, and so sequentially derives them one after the
other starting with the original `cameraDomain`.

```cpp
CameraSample ThinLensCamera::sample(const oqmc::PmjSampler cameraDomain)
{
	enum DomainKey
	{
		Next,
	};

	// Derive 'lensDomain' from 'cameraDomain' parameter.
	const auto lensDomain = cameraDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Next);

	// Derive 'timeDomain' from 'lensDomain' variable.
	const auto timeDomain = lensDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Next);

	// Take two samples for lens to compute a CameraSample object.
	float lensSamples[2];
	lensDomain.drawSample<2>(lensSamples);

	// Take a single sample for time to compute a CameraSample object.
	float timeSamples[1];
	timeDomain.drawSample<1>(timeSamples);

	// Compute CameraSample object using the drawn samples...
}
```

This is the dangerous part! It is to do with the calling code from the previous
example. Notice that `cameraDomain` is used to derive both `materialDomain` and
`lensDomain`. These objects are now equivalent, and only differ in name.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-2-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-2-dark.png">
  <img alt="lattice pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-2-light.png">
</picture>

`materialDomain` and `lensDomain` objects being equivalent results in the drawn
samples being correlated in a way that leaves gaps in the primary sample space.
That results in a biased estimate, which is bad. But this can be fixed. Here is
a revised version of the calling code.

```cpp
Result estimatePixel(const oqmc::PmjSampler pixelDomain,
                     const CameraInterface& camera,
                     const MaterialInterface& material)
{
	enum DomainKey
	{
		Camera,
		Material,
	};

	// Derive 'cameraDomain' from 'pixelDomain' parameter.
	const auto cameraDomain = pixelDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Camera);

	// Derive 'materialDomain' from 'pixelDomain' parameter.
	const auto materialDomain = pixelDomain.newDomain(DomainKey::Material);

	// Pass domains directly to the interface to compute samples.
	const auto cameraSample = camera.sample(cameraDomain);
	const auto materialSample = material.sample(materialDomain);

	// Using samples, compute pixel estimate.
	return sampleLightTransport(cameraSample, materialSample);
}
```

You may notice that the `DomainKey` enum has now changed. And instead of
chaining the domains sequentially, the code now derives both `cameraDomain` and
`materialDomain` directly from `pixelDomain` with a different key.

This operation is called branching. The resulting domains are now independent.
You can branch a domain on a given key either with an enum as seen here, or by
passing an integer value directly.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-3-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-3-dark.png">
  <img alt="lattice pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-3-light.png">
</picture>

Now that `cameraDomain` and `materialDomain` are independent, the
`ThinLensCamera` can use the domain passed to it in whichever way it needs.

Mapping domains to the code's call graph creates domain trees. If you are
careful to derive domains sequentially in loops and to apply branching across
interfaces, there is a guarantee your algorithm will not create gaps in the
primary sample space and produces bias-free results.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-4-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-4-dark.png">
  <img alt="lattice pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/domain-tree-graph-4-light.png">
</picture>

OpenQMC's design makes domain trees a first-class concept and lets you focus on
writing complex and correct sampling code by applying the techniques described.

Here is what this example has identified. Gaps in the primary sample space
produce bias. Branching can be used to make domains independent of one another.
This independence prevents such bias. Finally, domain trees should match the
call graph of the code to guarantee bias-free results. For a more complete
example, see the [trace](src/tools/lib/trace.cpp) tool.

## Implementation details

This section will go into detail about each back-end implementation, as well as
the blue noise variants. Here you can find out about practical trade-offs for
each option, so you can decide which is best for your use case.

### PMJ sequences

The implementation uses the stochastic method described by Helmer et la. [^2]
to efficiently construct a progressive multi-jittered (0,2) sequence. The first
pair of dimensions in a domain have the same integration properties as the
Sobol implementation. However, as the sequence doesn't extend to more than two
dimensions, the second pair is randomised relative to the first in a single
domain.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/pmj-design-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/pmj-design-dark.png">
  <img alt="PMJ pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/pmj-design-light.png">
</picture>

This sampler pre-computes a base 4D pattern for all sample indices during the
cache initialisation. Permuted index values are then looked up from memory at
runtime, before being XOR scrambled. This amortises the cost of initialisation.
The rate of integration is very high, especially for the first and second pairs
of dimensions. You may however not want to use this implementation if memory
space or access is a concern.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/plots/pair-plot-pmj-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/plots/pair-plot-pmj-dark.png">
  <img alt="PMJ pair plot." src="./images/plots/pair-plot-pmj-light.png">
</picture>

### Sobol sequences

The implementation uses an elegant construction by Burley [^1] for an Owen
scrambled Sobol sequence. This also includes performance improvements such as
limiting the index to 16 bits, pre-inverting the input and output matrices, and
making use of CPU vector intrinsics. You need to select a `OPENQMC_ARCH_TYPE` to
make use of the performance from vector intrinsics for a given architecture.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/sobol-design-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/sobol-design-dark.png">
  <img alt="sobol pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/sobol-design-light.png">
</picture>

This sampler has no cache initialisation cost, it generates all samples on
the fly without touching memory. However, the cost per draw sample call is
computationally higher than other samplers. The quality of Owen scramble
sequences often outweigh this cost due to their random error cancellation and
incredibly high rate of integration for smooth functions.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/plots/pair-plot-sobol-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/plots/pair-plot-sobol-dark.png">
  <img alt="Sobol pair plot." src="./images/plots/pair-plot-sobol-light.png">
</picture>

### Lattice sequences

The implementation uses the generator vector from Hickernell et al. [^3] to
construct a 4D lattice. This is then made into a progressive sequence using
a scalar based on a radical inversion of the sample index. Randomisation uses
toroidal shifts.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/lattice-design-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/lattice-design-dark.png">
  <img alt="lattice pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/lattice-design-light.png">
</picture>

This sampler has no cache initialisation cost, it generates all samples on the
fly without touching memory. Runtime performance is also high with a relatively
low computation cost for a single draw sample call. However, the rate of
integration per pixel can be lower when compared to other samplers.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/plots/pair-plot-lattice-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/plots/pair-plot-lattice-dark.png">
  <img alt="Lattice pair plot." src="./images/plots/pair-plot-lattice-light.png">
</picture>

### Spatial temporal blue noise

The blue noise variants offer spatial temporal blue noise dithering between
pixels, with progressive ranking for progressive pixel sampling. This involves
an offline optimisation process that's based on the work by Belcour and Heitz
[^4], and extends temporally as described by Wolfe et al. [^5].

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/optimise-index-seed-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/optimise-index-seed-dark.png">
  <img alt="lattice pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/optimise-index-seed-light.png">
</picture>

Each variant achieves a blue noise distribution using two pixel tables, one
holds keys to seed the sequence, and the other index ranks. These tables are
then randomised by toroidally shifting the table lookups for each domain using
random offsets. Correlation between the offsets and the pixels allows for a
single pair of tables to provide keys and ranks for many domains.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/diagrams/blue-noise-procedure-light.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/diagrams/blue-noise-procedure-dark.png">
  <img alt="lattice pair plot." src="./images/diagrams/blue-noise-procedure-light.png">
</picture>

Although the spatial temporal blue noise doesn't reduce the error for an
individual pixel, it does give a better perceptual result due to less low
frequency structure in the error between pixels. Also, if an image is either
spatially or temporally filtered (as with denoising or temporal antialiasing),
the resulting error can be much lower when using a blue noise variant as shown
in [Rate of convergence](#rate-of-convergence).

For more details, see the Optimise CLI in the [Tools](#tools) section.

### Object state

The intention of the API is to allow for object instances to be efficiently
copied on the stack. In doing so the objects can be easily packed and queued
during wavefront rendering. Allowing for this means that along with the
possible 64 bits to track a cache, the state that uniquely identifies the
current domain and index of a sampler needs to be small as well.

For this purpose, each implementation uses 64 bits. Along with an optional
cache pointer, that gives a maximum of 128 bits for the entire object. Creating
new states for each domain relies heavily on PCG-RXS-M-RX-32 from the PCG
family of PRNGs as described by O'Neill [^6].

Each implementation uses the LCG state transition when advancing a domain, but
then increases the quality of the lower order bits with a permutation prior to
drawing samples. This allows the implementation to efficiently create and skip
domains, while producing high quality random results upon drawing samples.

## Development roadmap

Roadmap for version 1.0.0 of the library:

- Gather feedback and iterate.
- Add complete documentation.
- Add more package managers.

## Developer workflow

Beyond the library itself there are a range of tools and tests that make up the
project as a whole. These are there to aid development and to provide an element
of analysis. These extra components also have more requirements and dependencies
than the library alone.

### Installing LFS

Some of the files in the repository require Git Large File Storage which is a
common Git extension for handling large file types. You can find installation
instructions on the [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) website.

### Dependencies

The tools and tests have dependencies on external projects. If these are already
installed on the system they can be found automatically. If a dependency isn't
installed, then it will be downloaded and compiled along with the project.

The dependencies are:

- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [Hypothesis](https://github.com/joshbainbridge/hypothesis)
- [oneTBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB)

### Extra build options

There are a few extra options that go along with those listed in the [Library
build options](#library-build-options) section. These are specific to handling
the tools and tests. The options are:

- `OPENQMC_BUILD_TOOLS`: Enable targets for building the project tools. You may
  want to enable during development. Option values can be `ON` or `OFF`.
  Default value is `OFF`.
- `OPENQMC_BUILD_TESTING`: Enable targets for building the project tests. You
  may want to enable during development. Option values can be `ON` or `OFF`.
  Default value is `OFF`.
- `OPENQMC_FORCE_DOWNLOAD`: Force dependencies to download and build, even if
  they are installed. Useful for guaranteeing compatibility. Option values can
  be `ON` or `OFF`. Default value is `OFF`.

### Build configuration

You can use configurations for [Extra build options](#extra-build-options)
based on your operating system by referencing pre-defined CMake presets. The
preset for Linux and macOS has the name `unix`. Presets initialise the build
config so that it's ready for development. Do this by running:

```bash
cmake --preset unix
```

You can also override the options using the CMake CLI while initialising the
build config. If the build already exists, then CMake updates the option:

```bash
cmake --preset unix -D OPENQMC_FORCE_DOWNLOAD=ON
```

If you prefer to update the options using an interactive TUI rather than the
command line, then there is also the CMake curses interface command:

```bash
ccmake --preset unix
```

### Tools

The project comes with various tools that allow for offline optimisation of the
sampler implementations, as well as a way of evaluating the library results. A
benefit is that these tools also act as an example for users.

You can find the tools under the [src/tools](src/tools) folder. These make use
of the GLM and oneTBB external dependencies. You can build the tools using:

```bash
cmake --build --preset unix
```

Alternatively you can build a specific tool by specifying a target name:

```bash
cmake --build --preset unix --target benchmark
```

All tools link into a single library with a C API. You can find the source code
for this in [src/tools/lib](src/tools/lib) folder. Here is a list of some of the
key tools:

- [`src/tools/lib/benchmark.cpp`](src/tools/lib/benchmark.cpp) : Measure sampler performance.
- [`src/tools/lib/generate.cpp`](src/tools/lib/generate.cpp): Generate sample value tables.
- [`src/tools/lib/trace.cpp`](src/tools/lib/trace.cpp): Render a path traced image.
- [`src/tools/lib/optimise.cpp`](src/tools/lib/optimise.cpp): Run a blue noise optimisation.

You can access the library's C API via a Python CTypes wrapper. On Unix this
just requires the `TOOLSPATH` environment variable to point towards the shared
library binary and importing the [python/wrapper.py](python/wrapper.py) module.

This library is also linked against multiple CLI commands found in the
[src/tools/cli](src/tools/cli) folder. Once you have compiled the tools, you
can run the CLI binaries from the command line as shown:

<details>
<summary>Benchmark CLI usage</summary>

```
The 'benchmark' tool measures the time for cache initialisation, as well as the
draw sample time, independently for each implementation. The results depend on
the hardware, as well as the build configuration.

USAGE: ./build/src/tools/cli/benchmark <sampler> <measurement>

ARGS:
  <sampler> Options are 'pmj', 'pmjbn', 'sobol', 'sobolbn', 'lattice', 'latticebn'.
  <measurement> Options are 'init', 'samples'.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Generate CLI usage</summary>

```
The 'generate' tool evaluates a specific implementation and outputs a table of
points from the sequence. Currently the CLI sets the table output options to 2
sequences, 256 samples, and 8 dimensions.

USAGE: ./build/src/tools/cli/generate <sampler>

ARGS:
  <sampler> Options are 'pmj', 'sobol', 'lattice'.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Trace CLI usage</summary>

```
The 'trace' tool is a CPU / GPU uni-directional path tracer that provides an
example of how you might use the API in a renderer. There are multiple scenes
embedded in the source code, including the Cornell box used on this page. This
also demonstrates how each sampler implementation practically performs.

USAGE: ./build/src/tools/cli/trace <sampler> <scene>

ARGS:
  <sampler> Options are 'pmj', 'pmjbn', 'sobol', 'sobolbn', 'lattice', 'latticebn'.
  <scene> Options are 'box', 'presence', 'blur'.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Optimise CLI usage</summary>

```
The 'optimise' tool targets a single base sampler implementation and produces
the data needed to construct a spatial temporal blue noise variant. The output
is two tables, files named 'keys.txt' and 'ranks.txt'.

The table data can be mapped to a 3D array, with the axes representing 2D pixel
coordinates and 1D time. The optimisation process works toroidally, so you can
tile each table to cover a large spatial and temporal area.

Keys are 32 bit integers, and seed unique sampler domains. Ranks are also 32 bit
integers, and when XORed with the sample index allow for spatial temporal blue
noise with progressive and adaptive rendering.

When optimising final quality results it's advisable to use a GPU build of the
optimiser due to the computational cost. Testing with an NVIDIA RTX A6000 found
that this provided a speedup of ~400x that of the CPU.

USAGE: ./build/src/tools/cli/optimise <sampler>

ARGS:
  <sampler> Options are 'pmj', 'sobol', 'lattice'.
```

</details>

### Testing

The project aims to maintain full test coverage for all public library code.
That includes unit tests for individual functions and components. It also means
statistical hypothesis testing which validates the correctness of random
distributions.

You can find the tests under the [src/tests](src/tests) folder. These make use
of the GoogleTest and Hypothesis external dependencies. You can build the tests
using:

```bash
cmake --build --preset unix --target tests
```

Tests are then managed and run using CTest. You can run the tests using the
CTest CLI from the project root directory. Run the command:

```bash
ctest --preset unix
```

CTest then aggregates the results of all tests from the GoogleTest framework
and writes the results to the terminal. These also include the null-hypothesis
tests that build upon Wenzel Jackob's
[hypothesis](https://github.com/wjakob/hypothesis) library.

### Running commands

If all those CMake commands sound laborious, there is an easier way, and that
is using a command runner like [just](https://github.com/casey/just). You can
find instructions to install just on their site.

You call a command in just a 'recipe', and these recipes simplify the commands
in the above documentation. If you run the just command without any arguments
from the project root directory, it will display all available recipes with
a description:

```bash
just
```

As a developer, you can set up the project using the `setup` recipe. This will
run the commands described in [Build configuration](#build-configuration) using
the `unix` preset:

```bash
just setup
```

By default, just asks CMake to use [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) as the build
generator. Instructions on getting Ninja are on their site. If you would like to
use a different generator, you can pass a parameter to `setup`:

```bash
just setup `Unix Makefiles`
```

After this point you can use any of the other recipes just lists, some of
these take arguments as you saw with `setup` and should simplify the commands
listed in the [Build configuration](#build-configuration), [Tools](#tools) and
[Testing](#testing) sections.

Here is an example of a recipe building and running the tests:

```bash
just test
```

### Notebooks

All Jupyter notebooks used to author the images on this page are under the
[python/notebooks](python/notebooks) directory and are available to see
directly online. These use the tools Python CTypes wrapper.

Images on this page are generated with a build of the tools library, and then
executing the notebooks from the command line. This is done twice, once for each
colour theme. The process is automated in the following script:

```bash
./scripts/save-notebook-images.sh
```

### Nix development environment

On NixOS or systems with Nix available, the provided flake can be used to load a
working and reproducible developer environment. Load this with:

```bash
nix develop
```

For the extra dependencies and environment variables required to run the Jupyter
notebooks, there is a dedicated development environment:

```bash
nix develop .#notebook
```

Here are details on other related projects, and how OpenQMC is different. If
OpenQMC doesn't solve your problem, one of these might be a better option:

- [Uni{corn|form} toolkit](https://github.com/utk-team/utk) is a great resource,
  but is more intended for research rather than production use.
- [Andrew Helmer](https://github.com/Andrew-Helmer/stochastic-generation) gives
  a great example implementation of their sampler, but no general interface.
- [Pbrt](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4) is a seminal resource on all things
  rendering, but is written for educational purposes.
